                <p>Pro hac vice admission has existed since at least the year 1735, when it was employed in the free speech case of Crown v. Peter Zenger. With mass tort litigation and MDL on the rise in Ohioâ€™s federal district courts, pro hac vice admission is increasingly used by subject matter experts who wish to practice outside their home jurisdictions. Pro hac vice admission is also commonly used in single-plaintiff Ohio truck accident, products liability, and other personal injury cases, as well as in Ohio commercial litigation matters in which out-of-state companies prefer to use their home-state counsel.</p>

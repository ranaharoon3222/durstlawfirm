              <h1>Adept at Navigating Procedural Issues on Appeal</h1>
              <p>
                Procedural issues that present in the course of an appeal can be
                nerve-wracking, especially to a lawyer who does not typically
                handle appeals. Questions arise such as whether the judgment at
                issue is “final and appealable,” whether collection efforts may
                occur during the pendency of an appeal, whether a stay of
                execution is available (and if so, the likelihood of success,
                whether a request can be made on an emergency basis, and whether
                a bond must be posted), and what to do if a Rule 60(B) motion or
                other unresolved matter remains pending in the trial court.
              </p>

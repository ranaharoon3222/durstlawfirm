                I hired Alex Durst to represent me in a truck accident case that
                was very serious and traumatic. Everyone at the firm was super
                professional and responsive at all times. Especially Alex, who
                was great at keeping me informed and quickly addressed all my
                concerns whenever I was worried about something.
              </p>
              <p className={style.p5}>
                The truck company fought the case hard and tried to blame ME for
                the accident. My lawyers were not going to let that happen. They
                used private investigators to track down a key witness who was
                right behind me before the truck hit me who saw everything. Then
                they got bodycam videos from the police and a recorded 911 call
                from the truck driver that proved the truck driver was not
                telling the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, I got a GREAT settlement. It’s a huge relief to be
                able to move on from this terrible experience knowing justice
                was done. I’m so grateful to Alex for his help and having his
                firm on my side during this process.

                Alex was wonderful, caring, knowledgeable about the law and
                incredibly competent. I was injured by a drunk driver, when the
                driver rear ended my car. My rehabilitation required months of
                physical therapy and doctor visits. Alex filed a lawsuit
                immediately and proceeded aggressively against the driver. The
                driver’s insurance company proposed a non-binding mediation and
                Alex suggested we give it a try. We had nothing to lose because
                we could always say no and walk away. Alex prepared for the
                mediation by blowing up the pictures of what was left of my car
                immediately after the accident. (The car was totaled). These
                pictures were a great visual for the mediator and the insurance
                adjuster. We settled at the mediation for a significantly larger
                amount than what we initially thought we could negotiate. This
                was due to the fact that Alex adjusted his negotiation strategy
                as the negotiation progressed. When he felt we could negotiate
                for higher, he did.
              </p>
              <p className={style.p5}>
                Alex also helped us with a subrogation issue with our work-comp
                settlement. Because I was injured doing work related activities,
                I filed for worker’s compensation. I received a settlement from
                work-comp before the mediation and the settlement with the drunk
                driver. The work-comp insurance tried to take their money back
                out of my personal injury settlement. And in a typical situation
                they would likely have been successful. But, because the
                settlements happened in different states and according to
                different laws, Alex was able to find a technicality that could
                prevent work comp insurance from obtaining any money. Rather
                than testing Alex’s legal theory in Court, the work-comp
                insurance company decided to settle for literally 1/10 of the
                money they claimed they were owed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will refer everyone I know to Alex. I was very lucky to have a
                lawyer so knowledgeable and caring.

                While out of state on vacation I experienced a physical injury,
                followed by surgery, hospital stay, and lengthy recuperation.
              </p>
              <p>
                When talking with family about this experience I was asked if I
                had thought about contacting an attorney to walk me through this
                situation and help me determine if legal action could be taken.
                The name Alex Durst was mentioned. I contacted Atty Durst and
                explained my experience, asking if he would be willing to take
                this case (even though I live halfway across the country from
                his law office). After thorough research of the circumstances he
                agreed to take the case and encouraged me to follow my
                conviction. I’m so very pleased to say that he said he would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the entire (telephone and online) process of
                communications I found him to be very approachable and
                knowledgeable about the steps to be taken, making suggestions
                and negotiating on my behalf with determination, excellent
                communication skills, and complete follow-up to my questions
                with clear explanations.
              </p>
              <p>
                All worked together to bring satisfactory closure to this
                chapter in my life. I am very grateful and strongly recommend
                him as an attorney,
              </p>
              <p>Thank you Attorney Alex Durst!</p>

                He was communicable, very easy to work with, and I ended up with
                a better than expected settlement. Alex is understanding,
                trustworthy, and works hard to ensure the satisfaction of his

                Alex and his staff are knowledgeable and responsive. Alex was
                able to negotiate a settlement with the insurance company and
                their counsel that was more than 20 times what they had offered
                my wife and I prior to Alex’s representation! Alex has mastered
                the artful balance of being a bulldog for his clients while
                still maintaining the respect of opposing counsel and court
                personnel. If you are looking for representation that is honest,
                ethical, compassionate, and committed to the best outcome for
                your well-being…then look no further…Durst Law Firm will pursue

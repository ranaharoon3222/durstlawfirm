                  The trucking company fought [my] case hard and tried to blame
                  ME for the accident. [The firm’s] lawyers were not going to
                  let that happen. They used private investigators to track down
                  a key witness who was right behind me before the truck hit me
                  who saw everything. Then they got bodycam videos from the
                  police and a recorded 911 call from the truck driver that
                  proved the truck driver was not telling the truth. In the end,
                  I got a GREAT settlement.

                Corporate clients from all over the United States (and attorneys
                in need of local counsel) entrust us with complex commercial and
                employment matters that must be litigated or arbitrated in Ohio.
                People who have suffered life-altering injuries or lost a family
                member hire us in the most serious of transportation accident,
                products liability and other catastrophic injury matters â€“ often
                newsworthy cases that most firms are unequipped to handle.
              </p>

                We pursue every case relentlessly, using our battle-tested
                skills to craft imaginative solutions in and out of the
                courtroom. Few boutique litigation firms can match our record.
